            This four-pillar framework shapes a Montessori STEM preschool curriculum that
            Coimbatore families rely on, one that nurtures the whole child intellectually,
            emotionally, socially, creatively, and physically. Parents searching for the best
            preschool curriculum with a Montessori STEM approach will find that our NURTURE
            framework offers a level of depth and authenticity rarely found in conventional early
            childhood programmes.
